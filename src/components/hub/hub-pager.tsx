/**
 * The hub: Timeline, Library and Samwell as three pages of one screen.
 *
 * They used to be three routes with a swipe from a 44dp strip at each screen
 * edge standing in for a pager. That strip is the problem: on Android with
 * gesture navigation — the default on every current device — both screen
 * edges belong to the system Back gesture, so an edge-originated drag is
 * taken by the OS before the app sees the end of it. Measured on a Galaxy
 * A33, the gesture reported about 30dp of travel and then simply stopped
 * receiving touches. There is no threshold tuning that fixes that; the
 * gesture was in a place the app is not allowed to use.
 *
 * A pager takes the whole width instead, so it never goes near the edges, and
 * it is finger-tracked rather than triggered: the next page follows the drag
 * and can be pushed back before it commits. That is the difference the
 * routes could not give — a pushed route is not mounted until it is
 * navigated to, so there was never anything on screen to follow the finger.
 *
 * This is `ViewPager2` on Android and `UIPageViewController` on iOS, both
 * driven natively, which also means the drag keeps tracking while the JS
 * thread is busy.
 *
 * Peers, not a hierarchy: moving between these pages is not navigation and
 * leaves no history, so the system back button still means "leave the app"
 * from anywhere in the hub rather than walking back through pages the user
 * swiped past.
