/**
 * Holds an expensive region behind a placeholder, then dissolves the
 * placeholder into the real thing.
 *
 * Two separate problems, and the second is the one that is easy to get wrong.
 *
 * **Starting late.** A screen or sheet that renders everything in one pass
 * blocks its own entrance: the transition has nothing to animate until the
 * body has mounted and committed. Mounting the body a frame later lets the
 * entrance start on the frame of the tap and pays the mount cost while the
 * thing is already moving.
 *
 * **The blank frame.** Swapping the placeholder out on the same commit that
 * mounts the content leaves a gap: the content has been *mounted*, but it has
 * not *painted* — a virtualized list still has to measure and lay out its
 * first window — so for a frame or two there is nothing on screen at all. That
 * is the skeleton → blank → content flicker, and it reads worse than no
 * placeholder at all, because the eye has already settled on something.
 *
 * So the placeholder is not removed when the content mounts. It stays on top,
 * opaque, for two more frames — long enough for the content underneath to have
 * actually painted — and only then fades out to reveal it. The result is
 * skeleton → content with nothing in between.
 *
 * `ready` is how a caller says "the entrance is over, mount now". Mounting the
 * body while something is still animating is worse than mounting it late: the
 * commit competes with the animation for the UI thread and the motion stalls
 * partway, which reads as the thing jumping rather than arriving. Left `true`,
 * the body mounts as soon as the shell has painted.
 *
 * The overlay is opaque on purpose. A translucent placeholder would show the
 * content arriving through the gaps between its own bars, which is the same
 * pop in miniature. `surface` picks which ground it paints, because a sheet
 * sits on `popover` and a screen on `background`, and an overlay that guesses
 * wrong announces itself as a rectangle.
 *
 * `fill={false}` is for a region inside a page rather than the whole of one:
 * the part below a hero that is drawn at once (an episode's notes under its
 * artwork and buttons). Until the body mounts, the placeholder sits in the
 * page's flow and holds the region's height; once it has, the placeholder
 * covers the body as above, clipped to the body's size so a placeholder
 * taller than the content never hangs over whatever follows.
