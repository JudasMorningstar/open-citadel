 * out of step with the one it replaced, and the shelves visibly emptied and
 * filled again. Read from one clock, a placeholder that replaces another
 * carries on the same breath.
 *

 * before any setup, so the count touches zero in between: stopping waits a
 * frame, and a group arriving in that frame keeps it running.

/**
 * One pulse for a whole placeholder, instead of one per bar.
 *
 * This exists because the obvious construction — a `Skeleton` per bar, each
 * animating itself — is what made the drawers slow. A placeholder list is
 * twenty-odd bars, and `Skeleton` builds a shared value, an animated style and
 * an infinite `withRepeat` for every one of them. Measured on an A33, the chat
 * history placeholder cost **950ms** of the 1385ms between its sheet opening
 * and its content arriving; the same sheet behind a static view took 434ms. The
 * placeholder was not covering the wait, it *was* the wait.
 *
 * Driving one animated node and letting the bars be plain views collapses that
 * to a single mapper. It also looks better: the whole placeholder breathing
 * together reads as one surface waiting, where independent bars read as a
 * chart. Use `SkeletonBar` for the shapes inside it.
 *
 * `Skeleton` in `ui/` is still right for a lone placeholder — one bar, one
 * animation, nothing to amortise.
