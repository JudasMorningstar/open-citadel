 * The order the parts of the app take a new theme in.

 * A theme change redraws every themed component, and the app keeps most of
 * itself mounted. Handed to everything at once that was one pass of two
 * seconds and more on a Galaxy A33. Handed to "the screen in view now, the
 * rest later" it was still one lump for the rest, and React starts a lump
 * again from the top whenever something more pressing arrives: leave Settings
 * a second after the switch and the Library sat in the old theme for another
 * two and a half.
 *
 * So the rest is handed out in steps, each small enough to finish in the gaps
 * between presses, in the order someone could next see them: what is under
 * the screen in view first, the things hidden behind a tab or a row last.
 * `components/theme-scope` does the handing out; this says who is when.
