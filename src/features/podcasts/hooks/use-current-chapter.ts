 * The chapter playing, for the title above the scrubber.

 * It renders again only when the chapter changes. The position used to sit in
 * the player screen's state second by second, so the whole player rendered
 * once a second for as long as it was open, its opening and closing included,
 * for a title that changes every few minutes. An episode with no chapters
 * (most of them) is not polled at all.
 *
 * `active` is false while the player is still opening: the first frame goes
 * by where the audio is reckoned to be, and asking the player waits until the
 * screen has landed (see `readPlayback`).
