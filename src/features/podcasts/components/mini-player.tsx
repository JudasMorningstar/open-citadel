 * out of its artwork; the two controls on it are the two a listener reaches
 * for without looking: pause, and forward past an ad (or, once paused, close). Swiping it
 * down stops playback and puts it away. It comes and goes by the bottom edge
 * (`slideUpFromEdge`), and the floating buttons ride with it (`FabLift`).
 *
 * The listening progress is a gold hairline along the card's top edge
 * (`MiniPlayerProgress`), scaled on the UI thread, so a playing episode never
 * re-renders the screen under it.
