 * opened, and the header's way to the hub's other pages. The side last left
 * open is remembered, and the app comes back to it.
 *
 * A side is not mounted until it is opened, books included. Books used to
 * mount with the app whichever side it opened on, so someone who left the
 * Library on Blogs paid for the books side's skeleton, its shelves and their
 * covers underneath the page they were actually waiting for.
 *
 * What does start with the app is the books' DATA (`useLibraryBoot`): Samwell
 * reads the same store, and the launch scan belongs to the app opening rather
 * than to a side being looked at. So it lives here, and the books side is
 * told when it has landed.
