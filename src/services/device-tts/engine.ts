/**
 * The one loaded voice pipeline, held for as long as the reader might want
 * a voice — a singleton so repeated reading sessions never pay to reload it.
 *
 * "One" is deliberate: each Kokoro accent needs its own phonemizer, hence its
 * own pipeline, and Supertonic is a third, but two FP32 pipelines would double
 * the memory that already exhausts a 2 GB phone. So the loaded pipeline is
 * swapped when a voice of another accent or engine is asked for. That swap
 * happens inside the synthesis queue, so it can never dispose a pipeline that
 * is mid-utterance.
 *
 * This is a much thinner singleton than `device-llm/engine.ts`'s: Kokoro has
 * no per-conversation cache to share, so the only hazard is calling
 * `synthesize` twice at once, which `exclusive` alone covers. What is
 * deliberately NOT shared here is any notion of an active reading session —
 * which sentence is playing, where it paused — because on both the LLM and
 * TTS side, that state belongs to whatever is using the engine, not to it.
