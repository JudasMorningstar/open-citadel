/**
 * The voice engines' files on this device: fetching them, finding them.
 *
 * Same contract as `device-llm/files.ts` (see that file for the reasoning):
 * ExecuTorch's `download` owns the cache, so the app only ever asks the disk
 * directly whether a file `download` would use is already there, and never
 * calls `download` speculatively.
 *
 * Unlike an `LLMModel`, a `KokoroTtsModel`'s URLs are nested at different
 * depths (`modelPaths.durationPredictor`, `phonemizer.neuralModelSource`,
 * `voices.<name>`) and the voice set varies by language, so the file list is
 * collected by walking the object rather than a fixed set of keys.
