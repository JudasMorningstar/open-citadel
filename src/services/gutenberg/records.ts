/**
 * Project Gutenberg's books as the app holds them, and the small decisions
 * about them. Pure: no React Native, no I/O, so all of it is tested.
 *
 * What the app may do with them is set by Gutenberg's own policies
 * (gutenberg.org/policy/terms_of_use.html, license.html, robot_access.html),
 * and the rules that follow from them live here so no screen can drift:
 *
 * - The catalogue is read from Samwell Cloud's Gutendex, built from the bulk
 *   catalogue Gutenberg publishes for this use, never from its web pages.
 * - A book is offered for download only when the catalogue marks it public
 *   domain in the USA (`canDownload`). The few still under copyright are
 *   shared with Gutenberg by permission, and that permission is not ours to
 *   pass on, so those link to their page instead.
 * - The file is Gutenberg's, unmodified, license header and all.
 * - Links out go to a book's landing page, never to a file.
