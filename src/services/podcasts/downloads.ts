/**
 * Episode downloads: what is on the device, and the rules for fetching and

 *
 * Files live in the app's own `podcasts/` folder under a name derived from the
 * episode id. Rows store only that name (see `podcast_episodes.download_file`)
 * and the path is rebuilt here on every use, so the iOS container moving
 * between launches cannot strand a download the way it once stranded books.
 *
 * The rules around downloads are AntennaPod's: an episode whose download was
 * deleted is not fetched again by auto-download, and a played episode's file
 * can be removed on its own when the listener asked for that.
