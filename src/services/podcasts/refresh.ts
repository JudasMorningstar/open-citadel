/**
 * Refreshing every followed show, the way AntennaPod's `FeedUpdateWorker`
 * does: four feeds at a time, skipping any refreshed within the interval
 * unless the listener asked (a pull), and one failing feed never stopping the
 * rest. Afterwards: newly published episodes are downloaded where that is
 * wanted, and previews nobody followed are tidied away.
 *
 * AntennaPod runs this from a background job. There is no background job here
 * yet, so it runs when the app comes to the front and when Podcasts is opened,
 * whenever the interval has passed — which is when the listener would see the
 * result anyway.
