 * onboarding conversation is its own thing). Two ways in:
 * - a chat about a whole book or post waits there as the chat's book until
 *   the first message makes the conversation (`useChatSessions.send`), as
 *   picking a book on the page does;
 * - a chat about a passage (from the reader or the Timeline) is made where
 *   the passage is, with its context, and opened there.
